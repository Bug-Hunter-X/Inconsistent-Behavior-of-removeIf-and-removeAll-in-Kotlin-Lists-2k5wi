This repository demonstrates an inconsistency in the behavior of Kotlin's `removeIf` and `removeAll` functions when used with custom predicates on lists of different types.  The unexpected behavior is particularly noticeable when comparing the results of using these methods with lists of Int and String types.  The `bug.kt` file shows the inconsistent behavior. A potential solution (though not a guaranteed fix as the root cause may lie within the Kotlin standard library implementation) is presented in `bugSolution.kt`.
